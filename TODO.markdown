# webtransportd — TODO

A standalone C WebTransport (HTTP/3) daemon that exec's a child process
per accepted session and pipes data between the WT session and the
child's stdin/stdout. Modeled on
[websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd).

Built strictly red-green-refactor: every feature is driven by a failing
test, committed when green, then any cleanup is done with the test
still green. ASAN + UBSAN run on every test. The source tree is
self-contained — mbedtls, picoquic, and picotls are all vendored under
`thirdparty/` so there is no system TLS package dependency.

## Next up

### Cycle 21+ — Real handshake, picoquic bootstrap, end-to-end echo

Cycle 21 from the original plan was too fat. Split into sub-cycles,
each driven by one failing test:

- ✅ **21a (done)**: vendored `error_names.c` compiles with
  `-isystem thirdparty/picoquic/picoquic` and the four Godot-style
  defines (`PICOQUIC_WITH_MBEDTLS`, `PTLS_WITHOUT_OPENSSL`,
  `PTLS_WITHOUT_FUSION`, `DISABLE_DEBUG_PRINTF`). Vendored TUs use
  `-w` (sanitizers still on) so their warnings don't stop our
  `-Werror` build.
- ✅ **21b (done)**: every `thirdparty/picoquic/picoquic/*.c` (50 TUs,
  minus Windows-only `winsockloop.c`) compiles under VENDOR_CFLAGS
  with the wider include path (`picotls/include`, `mbedtls/include`,
  `picoquic_mbedtls`, `picohttp`). `picoquic_link_test` force-builds
  the entire object set as a prereq so any compile regression in any
  picoquic TU turns `make test` red.
- ✅ **21c (done)**: full vendored build + link. picohttp, picotls/lib
  (minus certificate_compression/fusion/mbedtls/mbedtls_sign/openssl),
  picotls/lib/cifra (minus libaegis — needs external `<aegis.h>`),
  cifra internals (minus test drivers + curve25519.donna/.naclref;
  curve25519.c wraps tweetnacl inline), micro-ecc, picoquic_mbedtls,
  mbedtls/library (minus godot_core_mbedtls_platform's legacy
  config.h layout), and loglib all compile + link. `picoquic_create_test`
  calls `picoquic_create(8, NULL-cert, NULL-key, ..., zero_reset_seed,
  ...)` — asserts non-NULL return, then `picoquic_free` tears it down
  under ASAN+UBSAN without leaks.
- **21d (handshake)**: `handshake_test` drives a picoquic client
  against the daemon and asserts a WebTransport CONNECT reaches
  `picoquic_state_server_ready`.
- **21e (bootstrap)**: `picoquic_create` with server cert+key (or
  `--cert=auto` self-signed), `picoquic_set_alpn_select_fn_v2`,
  `picowt_set_default_transport_parameters`,
  `picoquic_start_network_thread`.
- **21f (path callback)**: register `_wt_session_path_callback` that
  on CONNECT exec's the configured child, allocates a `peer_session_t`,
  stores it in `path_callback_ctx`, and wires incoming stream/datagram
  frames to the child's stdin via the framing codec.
- **21g (echo)**: end-to-end echo test — the client sends a datagram
  + a stream message; the daemon pipes both through `/bin/cat` (or a
  small echo helper); the client receives identical bytes back in the
  same mode (unreliable ↔ unreliable, reliable ↔ reliable). GREEN
  drains the per-peer outbound work queue from the picoquic loop
  callback on `picoquic_packet_loop_wake_up` and dispatches to
  `picoquic_add_to_stream` / `picoquic_queue_datagram_frame`.

### Cycle N — Graceful shutdown

- **RED**: `SIGTERM` the daemon; all in-flight sessions close, all
  child processes are reaped, daemon exits 0, no ASAN leaks.
- **GREEN**: install `sigaction(SIGTERM, …)` that sets an atomic
  `should_exit` flag and calls `picoquic_wake_up_network_thread`; the
  loop callback checks the flag and returns
  `PICOQUIC_NO_ERROR_TERMINATE_PACKET_LOOP`. After the loop thread
  joins, free all `peer_session_t`s (each one SIGTERMs its child +
  closes the work queue) before `picoquic_free`.

## After the daemon works

- **CI**: `.github/workflows/webtransportd.yml` — three-job matrix
  (`linux-gcc`, `macos-clang`, `windows-clang-cl`), `actions/checkout@v4`,
  only compiler toolchain installed (no TLS package), `make test`
  must pass, `./webtransportd --version` smoke, upload the built
  binary via `actions/upload-artifact@v4`. Treat warnings as errors
  (`-Werror` / `/WX`).
- **Windows parity**: `Makefile.win` + `sources.mk` so the POSIX and
  `nmake` paths share the same source list.
- **Docs**: top-level `README.md` (usage, framing spec, CLI flags,
  relationship to Godot), `LICENSE` (BSD-2 for the daemon we author;
  upstream libs keep their own licenses in `thirdparty/*/LICENSE*`),
  `AUTHORS`, `CHANGES`.
- **Examples**: `examples/echo.c` (smallest compliant child),
  `examples/echo.sh` + `examples/frame-helper.sh` (shell-friendly
  framing helpers).

## Future cycles (once v0.1 ships)

- **RED**: fuzz harness for the frame codec (libFuzzer against
  `wtd_frame_decode`; should never crash or report
  heap-buffer-overflow under ASAN).
- **RED**: `--cert=auto` persistence — generated cert+key survive a
  daemon restart.
- **RED**: per-peer flow control — if the child's stdin pipe is full,
  apply WT stream flow-control backpressure instead of dropping
  unreliable frames.
- **RED**: 8-byte varint support + a configurable
  `WTD_FRAME_MAX_PAYLOAD` so large reliable payloads don't force a
  session close.
- **RED**: a real Windows `child_process_win.c` (today's
  implementation is POSIX-only; Windows ships the daemon binary but
  not the child-plumbing path yet).
- **RED**: stderr-from-child forwarding to `wtd_log` (currently the
  `stderr_fd` pipe is opened but unread).
- **RED**: `--dir` / `--staticdir` equivalents — serve static files
  on non-WT paths for the devconsole case, mirroring
  websocketd's `http.go`.

## Guiding principles (keep revisiting)

- **RED first, always.** Before writing code, write a test that
  compiles (or add only the bare symbol to make it compile) and
  fails at runtime. Mutation-test characterization cycles
  (ones that pass on first run) by briefly breaking the code to
  prove the assertions are load-bearing.
- **Narrow the slice.** Each cycle should be one public behavior.
  If a RED needs two implementation changes to turn green, split it.
- **ASAN is part of the contract.** `-fsanitize=address,undefined`
  runs every `make test` — an ASAN finding is a RED, not a warning.
- **Commit every green.** One commit per cycle (or tightly-paired
  cycle), message starts with `Cycle N: …` so the TDD arc is visible
  in `git log`.
- **No SCsub, no `#include` from Godot.** Operational separation is
  the whole point. The vendored `thirdparty/` is a snapshot, not a
  symlink.
